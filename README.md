 A peaceful RESTful API framework for NodeJS. 
 ## Project Objective
 To provide type based JSON RESTful API which works with MySQL. 
 ### Why we need this framework?
 Currently have very few framework which translates the JSON parent -> child relations to MySQL relational table structure. 

 This framework address this issue by automating most of the HTTP CURD process with any level of parent -> child relationship.
 
 Adding strong type support will enable this project to be an enterprise, production ready, and hackable framework which reduces most of the work for developers who create APIs.

 ### How?
 - Creating a schema for all HTTP method which acts as blue print for all API calls.
 - Having a custom type support for validating.
 - Providing couple of developer hackable methods for each schema, which runs pre and post process.
 - Providing OAuth 2.0 support, which takes care of user registration and authentication.
 - Automate API document creation and API key (Client) generation.
 - Use as little or no other packages.
 - Follow most of the standards.
